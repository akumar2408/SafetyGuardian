This directory contains the web-based interface for the SafetyGuardian platform. It is built with React and Vite using TypeScript.

## Features

- Dashboard showing real-time safety metrics and alerts.

- Settings page to configure preferences and notification settings.
- Notifications panel for recent safety alerts and system messages.
- Integration with the backend API for AI-powered detections, translations, audio analysis and more.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be served at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. Build for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The frontend uses the Vite dev server for hot reloading and TypeScript support. For more information on the tech stack, see the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) and the [React documentation](https://react.dev/).
