"""
Audio service for SafetyGuardian.

This Flask application exposes an endpoint for classifying audio
events and converting speech to text. In a complete implementation
this would use Hugging Face models such as Whisper or Wav2Vec for
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and an audio classification model
trained on alarm and machinery sounds. Here, it returns a static
response.
