"""
Question answering and summarization service for SafetyGuardian.

This service exposes endpoints for answering questions based on a
given context and for summarizing text or logs. In a real
implementation it would load a multimodal language model such as
Qwen2‑VL or Llama‑3.2 Vision from Hugging Face and possibly use
RAG techniques to ground answers in uploaded documents. For this
skeleton it returns stub responses.
